To make our first contact as &amp;ldquo;painless&amp;rdquo; as possible, I&amp;rsquo;ve made the decision that the first tool I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you to is Postman. After finishing this series of articles, you will be able to generate your own project and environment variables, launch it from a Node.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://anxoportela.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anxoportela.github.io/contact/</guid><description> Name Email Subject Message Send</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://anxoportela.github.io/projects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anxoportela.github.io/projects/</guid><description>Each tutorial will have an associated project that will be listed on this page, each of them will have its respective link to GitHub, in which the operation of the various practices will be shown.</description></item><item><title>Thankyou</title><link>https://anxoportela.github.io/thankyou/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anxoportela.github.io/thankyou/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll read your message as soon as possible and contact you.

With the knowledge acquired during my working life, and with a lot of effort and desire, I was able to successfully complete a double grade of Microcomputer Systems and Networks and Web Application Development at the CIFP A Carballeira - Marcos Valc√°rcel center.</description></item></channel></rss>
